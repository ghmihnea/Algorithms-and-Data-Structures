# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
This repository is a collection of my work and practice throughout the Algorithms and Data Structures course. It includes assignments, exercises, and small projects that I worked on to better understand the concepts.
I’m using this space as a way to learn by doing. The code here may not be perfect, but that’s the point — it’s all part of my learning process.
⚙️ What’s Inside

- Practice Exercises – Implementations of algorithms and data structures.

- Projects – Larger tasks where I tried applying what I learned.

- Notes – Some explanations and thoughts I wrote down while practicing.
⚙️ Topics I’ve Practiced

-Algorithm analysis (Big-O, Big-Θ, Big-Ω)

-Sorting and searching techniques

-Recursion and divide-and-conquer

Data structures:

-Arrays, Linked Lists

-Stacks, Queues

-Trees and Heaps

-Graphs and related algorithms

-Greedy and dynamic programming approaches
